To help us to stop using pre-commit hooks, and stop not detected linting issues in the middle of the project.
This workflow help us to detect Linting issues with annotations in the PR, and it fixes other issues auto. 

The awesome action wearerequired/lint-action@v2 is available for sereval languages, but here it is impoved to use within our TS projects.
